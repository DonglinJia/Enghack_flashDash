# flashDash

A basic flashcard creator and viewer android app made using Android Studio/Java for Enghacks 2018
Mostly just a way for me learn more about Android Studio and Java.
Helped with group members to debug and refactor code.

App funciton:
When reading the content from the user; it spilts words and definiton by ':', store the word and the definition in two arrays;
When accessing the word or the definition, the corresponding one will show up.
